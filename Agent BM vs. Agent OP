    Agent-based modeling or (ABM) and agent-oriented programming or (AOP) both focus on AI entities, but they serve fundamentally different purposes, ABM is a scientific modeling technique used to simulate systems, while AOP is a software engineering program used to build them. In agent-based modeling, the primary goal is research and analysis. It is a "bottom-up" approach where researchers define simple rules for individual agents to observe how complex, emergent behaviors arise at a system-wide level. It is widely used in fields like biology, social sciences, and economics to test hypotheses or predict the behavior of natural systems, such as the spread of a disease or the fluctuations of a stock market. In contrast, agent-oriented programming is a method for organizing and writing computer code, often viewed as a specialized evolution of object-oriented programming. Rather than focusing on simulated outcomes, AOP focuses on the architecture of software where the "agent" is the basic unit of execution, characterized by mental states like beliefs, commitments, and intentions. While ABM agents are often simple entities used to generate data for study, AOP agents are sophisticated software components designed to perform specific engineering tasks, communicate through structured protocols (like requests or promises), and solve practical problems in distributed or complex computing environments.
